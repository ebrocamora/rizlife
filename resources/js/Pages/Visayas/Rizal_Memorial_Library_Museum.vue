	  				Rizal Memorial Library and Museum is a three-story, pre-war, neoclassical legacy site and landmark in Cebu City, Philippines. Dedicated to the national legend, Jose P. Rizal, it was planned by Filipino modeler Juan Marcos Arellano, who moreover planned the Cebu Common Capitol building. Introduced in 1939, the building survived World War II. It is found along Osme√±a Boulevard and houses the workplaces of Cebu City Tourism, the Cultural and Historical Affairs Commission, the Sinulog Hall on the third floor, the Cebu City Museum of Visual Arts on the second floor, and the Cebu City Open Library on the ground floor.
