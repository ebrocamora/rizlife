  				Rizal Avenue, also known as Avenida or Avenida Rizal, is one of Manila's main thoroughfares. Named after the national hero Jos√© Rizal, it is a part of Radial Road 9 (R-9). The LRT Line 1 elevated railroad is built above the street in its entire length, and several jeepneys ply the area taking passengers from Caloocan, Quezon City, and Valenzuela. Most of the street is within Santa Cruz, Manila. By the 1960s, economic activities shifted from Binondo to Makati.
